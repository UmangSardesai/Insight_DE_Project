# Insight Data Engineering Project - 18B

## Summary
Low Latency search of high velocity incoming data

## Purpose
Search engine is based on indexing. Search results are dependent of two things. 

a) How fast is the indexing 
b) How efficient is the indexing.

Streaming data - Data changes continuously. That means index changes continuously., which makes it very difficult to search.

Elastic Search provides Percolators which is specifically used for stream data. 
However can it scale?

## Use case:
Amazon Customer support.

More details to be added soon. In the meantime, please view the project slides [here](bit.ly/StreamSearchSlides).
